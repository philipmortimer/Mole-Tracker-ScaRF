A project developed for the Skin Cancer Research Fund, a charity that operates from Southmead Hospital in Bristol. This app is still under development but will be deployed to allow patients to photograph and track skin lesions. These lesions pictures can then be reviewed by a doctor, to identify any potentially cancerous ones. I worked on this project with four others for about 3 months. 

This smartphone app features a 3D body model, allowing patients to record exactly where a specific mole is.

Patients are prompted to photograph these moles periodically. The moles can then be sent via email to a doctor, who can check to see whether they are cancerous.

# SkinCancer

## Overview
A application which enables users to monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer.

The app has the following features:
* An interactive 3D environment and gender specific model, enabling users to identify where on their body a mole is located.
* Serial photographs, both near and far, taken over a period of time, to enable users to monitor the appearance of their moles.
* A ghost image to be displayed when taking a photograph of a mole, to help users take consistent photographs.
* Notifications that users can opt-in or opt-out of, reminding them to take updated photographs of their moles.
* A link to the mail app, so users can send photographs of a mole to their GP or other third parties.
* Pages of information to educate users on skin cancer, containing text, photographs and videos.
* Information pointers to help users navigate the app and use key features.
* SCaRF charity logo should be displayed, with a link for anyone to send donations.
* User-friendly interface.
