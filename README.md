# SkinCancer

## Overview
A application which enables users to monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer.

The app has the following features:
* An interactive 3D environment and gender specific model, enabling users to identify where on their body a mole is located.
* Serial photographs, both near and far, taken over a period of time, to enable users to monitor the appearance of their moles.
* A ghost image to be displayed when taking a photograph of a mole, to help users take consistent photographs.
* Notifications that users can opt-in or opt-out of, reminding them to take updated photographs of their moles.
* A link to the mail app, so users can send photographs of a mole to their GP or other third parties.
* Pages of information to educate users on skin cancer, containing text, photographs and videos.
* Information pointers to help users navigate the app and use key features.
* SCaRF charity logo should be displayed, with a link for anyone to send donations.
* User-friendly interface.
